# Exercise 5: Chunk Iterator
# Create an iterator class called ChunkIterator that takes an iterable and a chunk size. The iterator should yield chunks of the given size as lists.

# Example usage:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# chunker = ChunkIterator(numbers, 3)
# for chunk in chunker:
#     print(chunk)

# Expected output:

# [1, 2, 3]
# [4, 5, 6]
# [7, 8]
