# Exercise 8: Flatten Iterator
# Create an iterator class called FlattenIterator that takes a nested list and flattens it into a single sequence of elements.

# Example usage:

# nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], [6]]
# flattener = FlattenIterator(nested_list)
# for num in flattener:
#     print(num)

# Expected output:

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
