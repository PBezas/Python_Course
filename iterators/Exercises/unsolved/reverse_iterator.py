# Exercise 6: Reverse Iterator
# Create an iterator class called ReverseIterator that takes a list and iterates over it in reverse order.

# Example usage:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# reverser = ReverseIterator(numbers)
# for num in reverser:
#     print(num)

# Expected output:

# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
