# Exercise 10: Unique Iterator
# Create an iterator class called UniqueIterator that takes an iterable and yields only unique elements, preserving the order of their first occurrence.

# Example usage:

# numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
# unique = UniqueIterator(numbers)
# for num in unique:
#     print(num)

# Expected output:

# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
